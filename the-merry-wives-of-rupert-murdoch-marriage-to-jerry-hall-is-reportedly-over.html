Hall was the billionaire media mogul’s fourth wife.</p><h2 id=patricia-booker>Patricia Booker</h2><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Rupert Murdoch’s first wife was Patricia Booker, a flight attendant and department store model from Melbourne. The couple wed in 1956 in Australia, when he was 25. They had one child, their daughter Prudence who is a newspaper executive, and divorced in 1967 after an 11-year marriage.</p><h2 id=anna-torv>Anna Torv</h2><figure id=feb98461-43ce-4df2-aac6-dd3dbc0a3975 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Rupert Murdoch with Anna Torv at the Humanitarian of the Year Awards in New York City in 1997.</span> Photograph: Evan Agostini/Getty Images</figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>A year later, Murdoch married Glasgow-born former newspaper journalist Anna Torv. They are believed to have met while Torv was working for Murdoch’s Sydney newspaper, the Daily Mirror, when she had the opportunity to interview him. The media mogul divorced Torv, in 1999, after 32 years of marriage. They have three children: Elisabeth, Lachlan and James.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Torv once praised her husband as a “very good and moral human being” whose ownership of the Sun newspaper was often taken out of context. She was a main board director of News Corp from 1990 until the two separated.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>In a 2001 interview with Australian Women’s Weekly on their separation, Anna said: “I began to think the Rupert Murdoch that I loved died a long time ago. Perhaps I was in love with the idea of still being in love with him. But the Rupert I fell in love with could not have behaved this way.”</p><h2 id=wendi-deng>Wendi Deng</h2><figure id=60e6f522-4c20-4f40-9ecf-b55c620689ae data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Wendi Deng arrives for the Met Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City in May.</span> Photograph: Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images</figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The 91-year-old Murdoch was married to Chinese-born businesswoman <a href=# data-link-name="in body link" data-component=auto-linked-tag>Wendi Deng</a> for 14 years. They met at a company party in Hong Kong in 1997 while Deng, who was more than 30 years his junior, was an intern at a TV station owned by News Corp.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Two years later, the couple exchanged their vows onboard Murdoch’s garland-bedecked yacht, the Morning Glory, in New York Harbour. They divorced in 2014 and have two children, Grace and Chloe.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Murdoch cited irretrievable breakdown in the marriage for more than six months as the reason for the divorce. Deng, born in China and educated at Yale, was credited with a makeover of her partner, introducing him to a younger, more tech-savvy set of friends including the Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and Twitter’s co-founder, Jack Dorsey.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Deng famously blocked an attack by protester Jonathan May-Bowles, who threw a pie at her husband during a British parliamentary committee hearing into the News International phone-hacking scandal in 2011.</p><h2 id=jerry-hall>Jerry Hall</h2><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Murdoch <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">tied the knot</a> with Jerry Hall at St Bride’s church in London in 2016, having met a year earlier.</p><figure id=8b0c16b1-344d-4175-9731-73826722ae2c data-spacefinder-role=richLink data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement class=dcr-1your1i><a href=# class=dcr-1m887w9>Cynicism meets sentimentality as Rupert Murdoch weds Jerry HallRead more</a></figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The ceremony was a week before Murdoch’s 85th birthday and guests included Bob Geldof, Sir Michael Caine and Rebekah Brooks, chief executive of Murdoch’s newspaper stable <a href=# data-link-name="in body link" data-component=auto-linked-tag>News UK</a>.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>It came after a five-month courtship with the former supermodel, who previously dated the Rolling Stones frontman Sir Mick Jagger for more than 20 years.
