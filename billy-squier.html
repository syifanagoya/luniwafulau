Rock musician who has released hits such as “The Stroke,” “Lonely Is the Night,” and “My Kinda Lover.”</p><p><a href=#>Eric Clapton</a> inspired him to pick up the guitar.&nbsp;inspired him to play the guitar.</p><p>Squier’s first public performances were at a Boston nightclub in Kenmore Square called the Psychedelic Supermarket in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band Cream. This encouraged him to take music more seriously and formed the band Magic Terry & the Universe with a school friend. In the early 1970’s, Squier tried out with various short-lived bands, beginning with The Kicks (not to be confused with the popular British band The Kinks) alongside future New York Dolls drummer Jerry Nolan. Squier also briefly attended Berklee College of Music in 1971. Squier was desiring to become a teacher, but he ended up moving to New York to form a band named The Sidewinders, which likewise lasted only couple years.</p><p>Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano for two years. Afterwards, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as another story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.</p><p align=justify>He got married to with his partner Nicole Schoen, a professional German soccer player, in 2002.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Billy Squier</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Billy</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Squier</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Guitarist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>May 12</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1950</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Wellesley</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Massachusetts</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Nicole Schoen</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Billy Squier ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Squier signed a solo deal with Capitol Records in 1979 and started working on his solo debut The Tale of the Tape, which was released in spring 1980. The album provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on Billboard’s album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier’s first singles “You Should Be High Love” and “The Big Beat” missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard’s backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020. Along with Chouinard, his backing band consisted of Alan St. Jon on keyboards, Cary Sharaf on lead guitar and Mark Clarke (who has previously had short jobs in Uriah Heep and Rainbow) on bass.</p><h2>Billy Squier Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Billy Squier is one of the <strong>richest Guitarist</strong> from United States. According to our analysis, Wikipedia, Forbes & Business Insider, <b>Billy Squier</b>'s net worth <strong>$40 Million</strong>. <b>(Last Update: December 11, 2023)</b></p><p align=justify>His first musical roots stemmed from playing the piano.&nbsp;He attended Berklee College of Music in 1970.</p><p align=justify>He didn’t take guitar lessons, but he did study music in the college.</p><p align=justify>William Haislip Squier (/ˈ s k w aɪ . ər / , born May 12, 1950) is an American rock musician and singer, who had a string of arena rock and crossover hits in the early 1980s. His best known and most favoured songs include “The Stroke”, “Lonely Is the Night”, “My Kinda Lover”, “In the Dark”, “Rock Me Tonite”, “Everybody Wants You”, “Emotions in Motion”, “Love Is the Hero”, “Don’t Say You Love Me” and “The Big Beat”. Squier’s best selling album, 1981’s Don’t Say No, is considered a landmark release within the arena rock genre and bridging the gap between power pop and hard rock.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$40 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Guitarist</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Following a small but fairly successful summer tour with Alice Cooper in 1980, Squier got in contact with Queen guitarist Brian May and proposed him to produce his next album. Due to scheduling conflicts, May declined, but he recommended Reinhold Mack, who had produced Queen’s most recent album The Game. Squier and Mack joined forces to produce Don’t Say No, which attracted rave reviews and spawned three hit singles, catapulting him to stardom. The first, “The Stroke,” became his breakthrough hit, hitting Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well as charting high in Canada and even in Britain, where the song remains his only chart entry. “In the Dark” and “My Kinda Lover” were successful follow-ups each. The album also featured “Lonely Is the Night”, which became a radio favourite and one of his signature songs, despite not being released as a single (however, in Britain, it was featured as the b-side for “In the Dark”). Squier was also popular on the new MTV cable channel, where his straightforward performance-based videos received heavy rotation. Don’t Say No peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling over 4 million copies in the US alone. Retrospectively, Don’t Say No is hailed as Squier’s best solo album and one of the greatest rock albums of the 1980’s.</p><p>His 1980 song “The Big Beat” is one of the most sampled drum breaks ever, being used by artists such as Run-DMC, Alicia Keys, Jay-Z, UTFO and Dizzee Rascal, to name a few. “The Stroke” has also shared its fair amount of sampling, most notably in Eminem’s 2013 hit “Berzerk”.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Billy Squier height</b> <strong>5 ft 6 in</strong> Billy <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 6 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In the mid 70’s, Squier encountered first real experience with the music industry after striking a record deal with his brand new band Piper, which went on to release two studio records, Piper and Can’t Wait. The band was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self-titled, Circus Magazine touted it as “the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band”. Piper was managed by the same management company as Kiss and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York’s Madison Square Garden. Squier served both as the main songwriter and frontman of the group.</p><p align=justify>Squier was known for being a perfectionist and short-tempered at producers sometimes. He ended his partnership with Mack after disagreements between the two escalated because of artistic differences. Despite the problems, Squier’s third album Emotions In Motion was released in 1982 and became very successful – though in the long run, it didn’t catch its predecessor in sales. Nevertheless, the album hit #5 in both US and Canada, sold approximately 3 million copies and spawned the successful radio and video hits “Emotions in Motion” and “Everybody Wants You”. The latter is notable for being Squier’s first #1 on the Mainstream Rock chart and holding the place for six weeks straight, more than any other number one in 1982. During the tour for Emotions in Motion, Squier and his band served as openers for the North American leg of Queen’s 1982 Hot Space Tour and later, he finally became a headliner act for the first time, ascending into the heavyweight of early 80’s hard rock. British newcomer Def Leppard supported him and he helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their breakthrough album Pyromania.</p><h2>Who is Billy Squier Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Billy Squier</strong> married to <strong>Nicole Schoen </strong>.

Squier stepped out of music business after the release of his 1993 release Tell the Truth, but he has occasionally continued performing smaller tours and one-off performances.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Billy Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Guitarist</strong>.

Billy Squier celebrates birthday on May 12 of every year.</p><p align=justify>Squier began writing songs for his fourth album Signs of Life in late 1983 after finishing his first headlining arena tour. In need of as perfect “extra set of ears” as possible, he planned Robert John “Mutt” Lange – the man behind Def Leppard’s wildly successful Pyromania – to produce the product. However, Lange was already reserved by The Cars and suffered a breakdown afterward, which prompted him to withdraw completely from the project Squier to hire a new co-producer just a few days before the sessions were set to start. He then brought in famed songwriter and producer Jim Steinman, who was better known for his grandiose ballads and operatic rock n’ roll songs as well as some of the biggest pop hits of early 80’s. Both Squier’s older fans and the music press reacted demurely to the Squier-Steinman team up, but since Squier admired Steinman’s work on Meat Loaf’s Bat Out of Hell – which he had described as “the most passionate and exciting rock record of our time” – and Steinman himself was willing to work again with a rock band, Squier stuck with him. Steinman showed great enthusiasm for the project and he got well along with Squier and his band, despite his role in the studio being significantly smaller than usually. The resulting album was a departure from Squier’s typical guitar-heavy hard rock into a more keyboard oriented style, with hints of Steinman’s wagnerian producing approach.</p><h3>Did a video ruined Billy Squires career?</h3><p>Unfortunately for Squier, like most singles of the day, “Rock Me Tonite” came with a video — and this particular video proved so hilariously awful that <b>it’s generally credited with sinking his entire career.</b></p><h3>What is Billy Squires net worth?</h3><table readability=3.5><tr>Net Worth:<b>$40 Million</b></tr><tr readability=3><td>Date of Birth:</td><td>May 12, 1950 (72 years old)</td></tr><tr><td>Gender:</td><td>Male</td></tr><tr><td>Height:</td><td>5 ft 6 in (1.68 m)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession:</td><td>Songwriter, Musician, Guitarist</td></tr></table><h3>Does Billy Squier still play?</h3><p>Billy Squier is an amazing classic rock performer.
