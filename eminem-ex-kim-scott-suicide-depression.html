I love you Momma!!! Kiss my dad and sister for me.”</p><p>Here we look Kim Scott's brave battle and how she's tried to overcome the adversity she faced.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Showbiz</h2></p><p>According to <a href=#>Eminem</a> - real name Marshall Mathers - the couple met at a house party when he was 15 and she was 13.</p><p>“I’m standing on top of their coffee table with my shirt off, with a Kangol on, mocking the words to LL Cool J’s I’m Bad. And I turn around and she’s at the door smoking,” he said.</p><p>Born in Warren, Michigan, Kim and sister Dawn - who didn’t know their biological dad - both left home at 13, allegedly to escape an alcoholic stepdad.</p><h2>Ran away at 13 to escape 'abusive' stepdad</h2><p>After running away from home she was taken in by Eminem’s mum, Debbie Nelson, who described her as a “tall, sulky blonde girl” in her memoir, My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem.</p><p>Debbie says the teenager opened up to her, claiming she had fled an abusive home.</p><p>“[She said she] had no idea who their real father was, and claimed to have been sexually abused by her stepfather,” Debbie wrote.</p><p>“Now, as often happens with troubled children, Kim told some pretty tall tales….I looked on Kim as a challenge, someone I hoped I could give a better life to.”</p><h2>Homeless and pregnant by 21</h2><p>Romance blossomed between the teenagers but, after Eminem dropped out of school to pursue a rap career, his mum threw them out.</p><p>The pair were forced to live hand to mouth in poverty-stricken areas where drug use was rife and burglaries common: “I went through four TVs and five VCRs in two years,” Eminem told Rolling Stone.</p><p>Kim was just 21 when she gave birth to <a href=#>Hailie Jade</a>, on Christmas day 1995, and they moved back to the trailer but Eminem claimed it was impossible to live there because of Debbie’s drug habit.</p><p>“My mother did a lot of dope and s***, a lot of pills — so she had mood swings,” he told Rolling Stone.</p><p>“She’d go to bed cool, then wake up like, ‘Motherf***ers, get out!'” She has always denied the allegations.</p><h2>Murder fantasy in lyrics</h2><p>The couple’s problems and the pressures of parenthood took their toll and caused frequent splits.</p><p>It was during one break that the rapper’s violent alter ego Slim Shady was born.</p><p>In a track on his breakthrough album, he fantasises about murdering Kim and dumping her body in the sea - with the help of toddler Hailie who appears on the recording.</p><p>“I lied to Kim and told her I was taking Hailie to Chuck E. Cheese that day,” he said</p><p>“But I took her to the studio. When she found out I used our daughter to write a song about killing her, she f***ing blew. We had just got back together for a couple of weeks.”</p><p>Despite the constant conflict, the couple married on June 14, 1999, shortly before Eminem’s first major tour, with Dr Dre.</p><p>But her husband’s fame had an adverse effect on Kim’s mental health.</p><p>“When Marshall’s first tour started is when his ego just went ‘poof,’ ” she told US TV's Dr. Keith Ablow.</p><p>“Like he was God, that’s what he thought. … I was just told that I should be grateful that he still talks to me, you know how many women throw themselves at him. And I just pretty much felt like a piece of crap.”</p><p>At one gig, in 2000, Kim watched as he sang Kim - another abusive song which contains the lines “bleed, b****, bleed” - while punching a nude blow-up doll made up to look like her.</p><p>“Seeing the crowd’s response and everybody cheering, singing the words and laughing and it just felt like everyone was staring at me,” she told Ablow.</p><p>“I knew that it was about me and that night I went home and I tried to commit suicide.”</p><p>Shortly afterwards, Eminem attacked rapper John Guerra, whipping him with a 9mm pistol, after Kim was reportedly seen kissing him.</p><p>After just a year of marriage the couple split, finalising their divorce in 2001, with Kim seeking £8million in compensation for “the intentional infliction of emotional distress” over the abusive lyrics.</p><p>The pair came to a settlement - with Kim receiving and undisclosed lump sum and £50,000 a year - and agreed on joint custody of Hailie.</p><h2>Married for 41 days</h2><p>Kim went on to have another daughter, Whitney, with Eric Hartter.</p><p>But the childhood sweethearts couldn’t stay apart, and rekindled the romance, with the rapper adopting Whitney as his own.</p><p>As Kim's sister Dawn was already struggling with drug addiction, they also took in her daughter, Aliana, who they later adopted, as well as Eminem’s younger half-brother, Nate.</p><p>The pair tied the knot again, in 2006, but Kim was reluctant to go through with it.</p><p>“Even on that day I said, ‘Let’s just go through the ceremony but not sign the marriage license.’ I was just afraid of what would happen if we had to go through a divorce, our kids. And then 41 days later, Feb. 25, Marshall left.”</p><p>Kim went on to have a son, Parker, although little is known about his father.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000672656144.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000672676976.jpg><h2>Drink and drugs before crash</h2><p>Kim has admitted she battled depression and drug addiction after their split, taking cocaine and being caught drunk behind the wheel, and she has been arrested numerous times for drug possession.</p><p>Eminem has also spoken out about his addiction to prescription pills, such as Vicodin and Valium.</p><p>After drinking rum and popping pills, in October 2015, Kim drove her Cadillac Escalade into a telephone pole, escaping with concussion and a broken wrist.</p><p>She later apologised and admitted she had been trying to kill herself.</p><p>“I sat at the end of a road where I knew that no one else but myself would get hurt,” she told US radio station 95.5 WKQI.</p><p>“Yes, I drank, I took pills and I hit the gas and aimed for a pole.</p><p>“I never expected to make it out of that alive. I apologised immensely. I did not even expect to make it through that, and I told [police] that I tried to do this on purpose.”</p><p>She added that people think “just because we have money, that it makes us happy.</p><p>“Yeah, I can pay bills. Yeah, I can get my kids whatever they ask for and it's great to see them happy. But you lose friends, you lose family, you have no one you can trust and you can speak to.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000574306136.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000672654397.jpg><h2>Setback after sister’s overdose</h2><p>Just months after the crash, in January 2016, Kim's twin sister Dawn Scott was found dead from a heroin overdose, in the Motor City Trailer Park.</p><p>Dawn - who had been homeless for two years - had slammed her sister for not helping her out, despite having millions.</p><p>But her death hit Kim hard, and she left an emotional message to "my sweet, beautiful sister who lost her way."</p><p>In the tribute on the funeral home website she wrote: "Half of me is gone - I kept a light lit for her, hoping she'd find her way back to me.”</p><p>The tragedy tipped her back into depression and she later revealed: “Honestly, I was starting to do better.</p><p>“After the death of my sister I had to go look at her dead in that trailer and just everything that was being said about her. It just hurts and now this.”</p><p>She added that Eminem had been “very supportive” of her. “We are very close friends; we are just trying to raise our kids together and make it as normal for them as possible.”</p><p>The pair have become increasingly close in recent years, with the rapper apologising for the way he treated her in his 2017 song, Bad Husband, and suggesting he hit her during their time together.</p><p>The song contains the lines: “We might have loved each other too much/ And maybe that's what made us do what we did to each other/ All the screw-ups.”</p><p>But while Kim has been getting support from her ex and daughter Hailie, now 25, the death of mum Kathy, at the home where Kim has nursed her through a long illness, was another blow - that tipped her over the edge once again.</p><p>In an emotional post she wrote: “We’ve had our riffs but not one second of one day would I not have given my last breath for you. Even now I’d rather it be me than you!!! You’re all I had left momma!!! What do I do now??”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>She added: “I don’t even know how to do this without you.”</p><p>But Kim’s latest attempt to take her own life will hopefully mean she gets the support she needs to get through.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">YOU'RE NOT ALONE</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>EVERY 90 minutes in the UK a life is lost to suicide.</p><p>It doesn't discriminate, touching the lives of people in every corner of society - from the homeless and unemployed to builders and doctors, reality stars and footballers.</p><p>It's the biggest killer of people under the age of 35, more deadly than cancer and car crashes.</p><p>Yet it's rarely spoken of, a taboo that threatens to continue its deadly rampage unless we all stop and take notice, now.</p><p>That is why The Sun launched the You're Not Alone campaign.</p><p>The aim is that by sharing practical advice, raising awareness and breaking down the barriers people face when talking about their mental health, we can all do our bit to help save lives.</p><p>Let's all vow to ask for help when we need it, and listen out for others...
