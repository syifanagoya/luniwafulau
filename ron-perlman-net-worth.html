Ron Perlman is probably best-known for the "Hellboy" movie franchise and the FX television show "Sons of Anarchy."</p><p>Perlman's breakthrough role came in 1987 when he starred as Vincent in the television series "Beauty and the Beast," a performance that won him a Golden Globe Award. However, he is perhaps best known for his role as the titular character in <a href=# title="Guillermo del Toro Net Worth">Guillermo del Toro</a>'s "Hellboy" (2004) and its sequel "Hellboy II: The Golden Army" (2008). These films showcased Perlman's ability to imbue physically demanding, makeup-heavy roles with depth and emotion.</p><p>In addition to his live-action work, Perlman has had a successful career in voice acting, lending his distinctive voice to animated films, TV shows, and video games, including "Adventure Time," "Tangled," and the "Fallout" video game series.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>He was born Ronald N. "Ron" Perlman on April 13, 1950 to Jewish parents in Washington Heights, New York, New York. Even though he was not considered traditionally handsome, Perlman became really popular in high school theater thanks to his height (6-foot-2) and his deep, rolling voice. Perlman graduated from George Washington High School in 1967. He continued mastering the acting craft at Lehman College and later at the University of Minnesota, where he graduated with a master's degree in theater arts in 1973.</p><h2 id=film-television-career><strong>Film and Television Career</strong></h2><p>After college he worked with New York's Classic Stage Company, an organization specializing in Elizabethan and Restoration plays, and performed in several feature movies. His first feature film was in Jean-Jacques Annaud's film Quest for Fire in 1981. Between 1981-1986, he appeared in various stage productions and various minor and supporting roles in films and TV series. His next substantial role came when he appeared as Salvatore in "The Name of the Rose" in 1986.</p><p>Perlman first made a name for himself and built a solid fan base when he was cast opposite <a href=# title="Linda Hamilton Net Worth">Linda Hamilton</a> in his breakthrough role of Vincent, the misunderstood Beast on the popular series "Beauty and the Beast" (CBS, 1987-1990), which also fetched him a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series in 1989. Before this, he had considered abandoning his acting career altogether.</p><p>Perlman went on to play thousands of roles in films and TV series. His most notable film appearances included "The Name of the Rose" in 1986, 1993's "Romeo is Bleeding," <strong>"</strong>The Adventures of Huck Finn" in 1993, "Police Academy: Mission to Moscow" (1994), "The Last Supper" (1995), "The Island of Dr. Moreau"&nbsp; in 1996, 1997's "Alien Resurrection" "Enemy at the Gates" (2001), "Blade II" and "Star Trek: Nemesis" (both 2002) and two <a href=# title="Stephen King Net Worth">Stephen King</a> adaptations, "Sleepwalkers" and "Desperation." His first leading film role came in 1995 when he played "One" in Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro's French-language feature film "The City of Lost Children." In 2003, he was cast in a commercial for Stella Artois beer called "Devil's Island" that won a Silver Award at the 2003 British Advertising Awards. His next leading film role came in 2004 when he played the title role in the comic book adaptation of "Hellboy." Perlman reprised his role as Hellboy in the straight to DVD animated features "Hellboy: Sword of Storms" (2006) and "Hellboy: Blood and Iron" (2007) as well as "Hellboy II: The Golden Army," which was released on July 11, 2008.</p><p>In 2008, Perlman landed his most notable television series role to date when he was cast in FX's "Sons of Anarchy" playing Clay Morrow,&nbsp; the national president of the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club. He appeared on the show for 75 episodes from 2008-2013. From 2014-2017, Perlman Judge Pernell Harris in Amazon's "Hand of God," a series for which he also served as an executive producer.&nbsp; He would also play Wes Chandler in the second and third seasons of "StartUp" in 2017–18.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-159478 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Ron-Perlman.jpg alt="Ron Perlman" width=594 height=395 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-159478 class=wp-caption-text>Alberto E.

Perlman offered his likeness and voice in 2016's "Call of Duty: Black Ops III" to one of the lead characters in the game's popular Zombies mode–an ex-boxer whose "desperate acts of violence to maintain prominence lead to imprisonment in a pocket dimension infested with hellacious creatures and lovecraftian horror themes."</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Perlman married his first wife, a jewelry designer named Opal, on February 14, 1981. Unfortunately, they separated in May 2019 and later divorced. The pair had two children together, Blake Amanda Perlman (b. 1984) and Brandon Avery Perlman (b. 1987).
