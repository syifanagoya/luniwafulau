Please respect our children’s and extended family’s privacy.”</p><p>However, aside from addressing her current situation following their divorce, the message did not reveal anything about the basis for their divorce.</p><p>Bandon filed for divorce on August 21, according to a source. The divorce papers, however, did not provide the reason for their divorce.</p><p>The couple rose to prominence as a power couple who created Austin New Church and published books.
