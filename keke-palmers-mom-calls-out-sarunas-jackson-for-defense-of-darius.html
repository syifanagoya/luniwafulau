Y’all will see,” Sarunas, 33, wrote via X (formerly Twitter) in a since-deleted post. “Just send positive energy to the babies.. Any child in the middle of something like this does not deserve it AT ALL. Wow. So damn sad.”</p><p class=p1>Sharon fired back at Sarunas: “For Sarunas Jackson to post on his Twitter the ridiculous stuff he’s posting when he knew his brother was abusive,” she said in a Thursday <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> video. “I went to Sarunas over a year ago and told him that his brother was abusive to my daughter and he said, ‘I used to be like that too.’ What?”</p><p class=p1>Sharon further claimed that “f—kboy” Sarunas, who is known for his role as Alejandro “Dro” Peña on<a href=#><i> Insecure</i></a>, taught his brother how to “be abusive to women.” She continued, “So, he don’t get to act like he’s this special guy.

But Sharon, the world is about to hear your voice. And the threats you made to my family.”</p><p class=p1>Darius has yet to publicly address Keke’s claims but <a href=#>posted “I love you, son.
